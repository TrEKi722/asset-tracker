# Wrangler configuration for Cloudflare (helps Pages detect Functions)
# Edit `account_id` if you publish with `wrangler`/CLI. For Cloudflare Pages this file
# is optional, but including it can assist build tooling and make routes explicit.

name = "asset-tracker"
# type for runtime
type = "javascript"
# Set to today's date (or the date you want compatibility for)
compatibility_date = "2026-02-03"

# Optional: uncomment and fill when publishing via wrangler CLI
# account_id = "your-account-id"

# If you need to explicitly define routes (usually not required for Pages Functions),
# add entries like below. Use the function filename (without extension) as the script name.
# [[routes]]
# pattern = "/api/*"
# script = "openrouter"

# Notes:
# - For Cloudflare Pages, ensure the `functions/` directory is at the repo root and contains
#   your function files (e.g., `functions/openrouter.js`). Pages will automatically map
#   `/api/<filename>` → corresponding function.
# - If the Pages deployment log still shows "No routes found when building Functions directory",
#   try adding a tiny `index.js` in `functions/` or ensure files are committed and pushed.
